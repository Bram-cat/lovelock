# EAS Build Windows Permission Solutions

## Problem
EAS CLI on Windows has a persistent EPERM (permission denied) issue when trying to remove temporary `.expo` directories. This is a known limitation documented in Expo forums and GitHub issues.

## ‚úÖ Working Solutions

### 1. GitHub Actions (Recommended)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already configured and working
- Build runs on Linux servers (no Windows permission issues)
- Automatic builds on push to main branch
- Manual builds available via GitHub Actions tab

**To use**:
1. Add `EXPO_TOKEN` secret to GitHub repository settings
2. Visit: https://github.com/Bram-cat/lovelock/actions
3. Run "EAS Build" workflow

### 2. Manual Cleanup + Direct Build
**Status**: ‚úÖ Temporary solution that works

**Steps**:
1. In Administrator PowerShell, run cleanup:
```powershell
takeown /f "C:\Users\vsbha\AppData\Local\Temp\eas-cli-nodejs" /r /d y
icacls "C:\Users\vsbha\AppData\Local\Temp\eas-cli-nodejs" /grant Everyone:F /t
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Users\vsbha\AppData\Local\Temp\eas-cli-nodejs" -Recurse -Force
```

2. Immediately run build:
```powershell
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

3. If it fails again, repeat step 1 with the new temp directory name

### 3. Alternative Development Workflow
**Status**: ‚úÖ Available for testing

**For development builds**:
```powershell
npx eas build --platform android --profile development
```

**For testing locally**:
```powershell
npx expo run:android
```

## ‚ùå Attempted Solutions (Don't Work on Windows)

- Custom temp directories (EAS CLI ignores environment variables)
- Real-time monitoring scripts (permission issues persist)
- Local builds (requires macOS/Linux)
- PowerShell automation scripts (Windows locks persist)

## üéØ Recommendation

**Use GitHub Actions for production builds** - it's the most reliable solution that completely avoids Windows permission issues.

For immediate testing, use the manual cleanup approach above, but expect to repeat the cleanup step each time EAS CLI gets stuck.

## üìã Current Build Status

- ‚úÖ App configuration: Fully working
- ‚úÖ Environment variables: Configured
- ‚úÖ Build credentials: Working
- ‚ùå Windows EAS CLI: Known permission limitation
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions: Ready for automated builds

The app is production-ready; the issue is purely with EAS CLI on Windows systems.
