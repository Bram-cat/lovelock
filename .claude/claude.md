# Lovelock AI Service Rework

## Issue
AI requests were getting stuck with "AI is analyzing..." and "Crafting your unique love profile..." messages, indicating the complex queue/rate limiting system was causing failures.

## Solution
Completely replaced the complex AI system with a simple, direct approach:

### New SimpleAIService Features:
- **Direct API calls** - No queues, no complex rate limiting
- **Dual Gemini keys** - Automatically switches between 2 API keys when one hits limits
- **Immediate fallback** - Gemini Key 1 ’ Gemini Key 2 ’ OpenAI ’ Static content
- **Minimal logging** - Reduced terminal spam
- **Fast responses** - No artificial delays or queuing

### Configuration:
- Primary: `AIzaSyAzAP3NQJyvY4rglOja86HFxjlJNjWzZJo`
- Backup: `AIzaSyBiOdLCC50Gw5valCvGdaR1Umr3CKxYsBs`
- OpenAI fallback when both Gemini keys fail

### Updated Components:
-  `screens/NumerologyReadingScreen.tsx`
-  `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
-  `app/(tabs)/love-match.tsx`
-  `app/(tabs)/trust-assessment.tsx`

### Files Cleaned:
- Removed 70+ unnecessary files (old Android/Firebase/Convex files)
- Removed temporary SQL migration files
- Project streamlined for better performance

## Test Commands:
```bash
# Run the app to test AI functionality
npm start
# or
npx expo start
```

The AI should now respond much faster without getting stuck on loading screens.
