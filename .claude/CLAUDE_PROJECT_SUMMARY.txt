Lovelock is a React Native + Expo numerology/astrology dating app that 
provides AI-powered insights for relationships, love compatibility, 
trust assessment, and personal numerology readings.

- Domain: lovelock.it.com

CLERK-SUPABASE INTEGRATION:
1. User signs up with Clerk (email verification required)

- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (varchar) - stores Clerk user ID
- email (varchar)
- full_name (varchar) 
- birth_date (varchar) - format: MM/DD/YYYY
- birth_time (varchar) - format: HH:MM AM/PM
- birth_location (varchar) - city, state/country
- wants_premium (boolean)
- wants_notifications (boolean) 
- agreed_to_terms (boolean)
- sign_up_date (timestamptz)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- updated_at (timestamptz)

EMAIL VERIFICATION ISSUES RESOLVED:
- Enhanced resend functionality with 60-second cooldown
- Better user guidance about email delays (2-5 minutes normal)
- Retry logic for email preparation
- Production email deliverability optimized
